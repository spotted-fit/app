## 🌐 API Configuration

The application supports two environment modes for API configuration:

### Debug/Development Mode
In debug/development mode, the application connects to a local backend server:
- Android: `http://10.0.2.2:8080` (special IP that maps to host machine's localhost for Android emulators)
- iOS: `http://localhost:8080`
- WASM/JS: `http://localhost:8080`

### Production Mode
In production mode, the application gets the backend URL from environment variable:
- Environment variable name: `BASE_URL`
- This is configured in the build.gradle.kts file using BuildKonfig

## 🐳 Docker for WASM

### Prerequisites
- Docker

### Usage
To build and serve the WASM application, run:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t spotted-app .

# Run the Docker container with the BASE_URL environment variable
docker run -p 80:80 -e BASE_URL=https://your-api-url.com spotted-app
```

This will:
1. Build the WASM application using Gradle inside a Docker container
2. Serve the WASM application on http://localhost:8080

### How it works
The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach:

1. **Build stage**: Uses Gradle to generate the WASM artifacts
2. **Serve stage**: Uses Nginx to serve the generated WASM artifacts

The WASM artifacts are generated in `composeApp/build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable` and served from there.

### Development
For development, you can run the Gradle task directly with the BASE_URL environment variable:

```bash
# Set the BASE_URL environment variable
export BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Run the Gradle task
./gradlew wasmJsBrowserDistribution
```

And then serve the artifacts using any web server, for example:

```bash
cd composeApp/build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable
python -m http.server 8080
```

Note: Make sure to set the BASE_URL environment variable before running the Gradle task, as it's required by the build.gradle.kts file.
